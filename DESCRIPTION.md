This extension allows you to log in to Plesk via LDAP (a central database storing multiple combinations of usernames and passwords). If you manage various Plesk servers, LDAP authentication allows you to log in to them using only LDAP credentials. You can:

- Enable LDAP authentication.
- Disable Plesk native authentication.

**Note:** Before you can start using this extension, you must install and configure the LDAP server manually.
